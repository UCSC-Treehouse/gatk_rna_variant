Running Platypus Docker

This guide uses Holly Beale’s server to access RNA seq data. If you want access to Holly’s server you need to 
talk to her and give her a ssh public key. After she gives you access do the following. 

1. 
Open your command line and enter: ssh yourusername@10.50.101.45

2. 
Use cd to change directories to where Platypus_Dockerfile is.

3. 
Then enter 

sudo docker build --file Platypus_Dockerfile --tag “cmargeru/platypus_docker” .

to build the docker image (make sure to include the period).

4. 
Once the image is built, in any directory, you can use:

sudo docker run -it -v /data/ref/:/data/ref \
-v /data/rnaseqVarCall/rawGATK_PipelineOutput/SAMPLE_DIRECTORY/:/data/work \
-e refgenome=GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fa \
-e input=SAMPLE.sortedByCoord.md.split.realigned.bam \
-e C_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/local/include \
-e LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib \
-e LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib \
cmargeru/platypus_docker

Note:
Here replace SAMPLE.sortedByCoord.md.split.realigned.bam and SAMPLE_DIRECTORY with the bam file
you wish to call variants on and the directory where it resides.

5.
This will start the docker container. Your username will change from your_username@hbeale-altref to something 
like root@4bd39a24e21c. Here all the software that you need will already be installed.

Now, change directories to /data/work:

cd /data/work

We need to prep your bam file for Opossum and Platypus, do so by entering:

samtools index $input
samtools view $input -b -o SAMPLE_PREOPOSSUM.bam chrZ:x-y
samtools calmd SAMPLE_PREOPOSSUM.bam /data/ref/$refgenome

Note:
Replace SAMPLE_PREOPOSSUM.bam with the name you wish for the output and change chrZ:x-y with 
the chromosome and bases that you want to look at (e.g. chr9:1023002-1023037). If you want to 
look at the entire chromosome, don't put anything for x-y. If you want to look at the whole genome. 
Don't incluce chrZ:x-y in the command.

6. 
Now your file is ready for Opossum. Platypus typically only works on DNA samples. So Opossum goes 
through and adds the introns back into the samples, so Platypus doesn't get confused. Run Opossum on your 
file with the following command:

python /root/Opossum/Opossum.py --SoftClipsExist=True --BamFile=SAMPLE_PREOPOSSUM.bam --OutFile=SAMPLE_POSTOPOSSUM.bam

Note:
Replace SAMPLE_PREOPOSSUM.bam and SAMPLE_POSTOPOSSUM.bam


7. 
Platypus is now able to handle your file. Run it with the following command:

python /root/Platypus_0.8.1/Platypus.py callVariants --bamFiles=SAMPLE_POSTOPOSSUM.bam 
--refFile=/data/ref/$refgenome --output=SAMPLE.vcf --region=chrZ:x-y

Note:
Replace SAMPLE_POSTOPOSSUM.bam, SAMPLE.vcf, and chrZ:x-y

8. 
After this, you are done. The results are now in SAMPLE.vcf. When you are done using the container 
enter "exit" into the command line to return back to Holly's server.
