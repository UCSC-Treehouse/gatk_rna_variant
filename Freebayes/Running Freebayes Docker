Running Freebayes Docker

This guide uses Holly Beale’s server to access RNA seq data. If you want access to Holly’s server you need 
to talk to her and give her a ssh public key. You must also be connected to the VPN. After she gives you access do the following. 

1. 
Open your command line and enter: ssh yourusername@10.50.101.45.

2. 
Use cd to change directories to where Freebayes_Dockerfile is.

3. 
Then enter 

sudo docker build --file Freebayes_Dockerfile --tag “cmargeru/freebayes_docker” .

to build the docker image (make sure to include the period).

4. 
Once the image is built, in any directory, you can use:

sudo docker run --rm -it -v /data/ref/:/data/ref \
-v /data/rnaseqVarCall/rawGATK_PipelineOutput/SAMPLE_DIRECTORY/:/data/work \
-e refgenome=GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fa \
-e input=SAMPLE.sortedByCoord.md.split.realigned.bam \
cmargeru/freebayes_docker

Note:
Here replace SAMPLE.sortedByCoord.md.split.realigned.bam and SAMPLE_DIRECTORY with the bam file
you wish to call variants on and the directory where it resides.

5.
This will start the docker container. Your username will change from your_username@hbeale-altref to 
something like root@4bd39a24e21c. Here all the software that you need will already be installed. 

Now, change directories to /data/work:

cd /data/work

Here you can use:

/root/freebayes/bin/freebayes --region chrZ:x-y --dont-left-align-indels --pooled-continuous 
--pooled-discrete -F 0.03 -C 2 -f /data/ref/$refgenome $input > SAMPLE.vcf

to run freebayes on your sample.

Note:
Once again, replace SAMPLE.vcf with the file name that you want your results to go and chrZ:x-y with 
the chromosome and bases that you want to look at (e.g. chr9:1023002-1023037). If you want to look at 
the entire chromosome, don't put anything for x-y. If you want to look at the whole genome. 
Don't incluce --region chrZ:x-y in the command.

6. 
After this, you are done. The results are now in SAMPLE.vcf. When you are done using the container 
enter "exit" into the command line to return back to Holly's server.
